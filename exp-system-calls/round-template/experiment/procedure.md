#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">System calls are executed in privileged/kernel mode. User programs are executed in user mode. User programs may need  services from operating system, so they invoke the system calls to get services. When it is invoked, in order to execute the system call operating system changes its mode from user mode to kernel mode. In the simulation how the operating systems serve a system call is demonstrated.</p>

<ul style="text-align:justify;">
	<li>In the simulation, click on "Next" button to move to the next step.</li>
	<li>Each step shows how operating system changes its execution mode from user mode to kernel mode to execute a system call and again switches back to user mode to continue execution of user program.</li>
	<li>Keep clicking on the "Next" button to see the next steps until simulation is over.</li>
