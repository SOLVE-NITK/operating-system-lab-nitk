#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator
<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This simulation covers different scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time First, Round Robin and Priority scheduling. This simulation helps to solve scheduling example using different scheduling algorithms and can find out the difference in the performance. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Follow the detailed procedure below to perform the experiments in the simulator : </p>
1. Choose a scheduling algorithm by selecting from the options given.</br>
2. Enter the count of participating processes.</br>
3. Enter the input values:</br>
<ul>
  <li type="a">If the algorithm selected is FCFS or SJF or SRTF then</li>
        <ul><li type="cirle">Enter the Arrival Time and Burst Time for each process</li></ul>
  <li type="a">If the algorithm selected is Round Robin then</li>
        <ul><li type="cirle">Enter the Burst time of each process</li>
        <li type="cirle">Enter the Quantum time</li></ul>
  <li type="a">If the algorithm selected is Priority Based scheduling which is non pre-emptive version:</li>
        <ul><li type="cirle">Enter the Priority, Arrival Time and Burst time for every process</li>
        <li type="cirle">Bigger number is higher priority</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>    
4. <span style="text-align: justify;">Click on "Simulate" button to start the simulation.</span></br>
5. <span style="text-align: justify;">The table below "Next" button will show the order in which processes are executed, and the Finish time, Turn Around Time and Waiting Time calculated for each process whose execution is completed will be shown in the main table.</span></br>
6. <span style="text-align: justify;">Click on "Next" button after each step to proceed, till the end of the simulation.</span></br>
7. <span style="text-align: justify;">Simulation ends once execution of all processes is over.</span></br>
